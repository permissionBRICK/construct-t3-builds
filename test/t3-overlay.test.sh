# Verify Construct's T3 Code source inventory against a REAL T3 source tree: apply the
# overlays + guarded transforms to a PRISTINE checkout, typecheck the transformed apps,
# and run the overlay's own Vitest files. This is the only place those checks can run —
# the overlays import from `@t3tools/contracts` and are executed by T3's own toolchain.
#
# A VM that has built the patched T3 keeps that tree in
# /var/cache/construct/t3code-source/<version-key>/ (a git checkout of the upstream tag,
# with node_modules installed). This script makes a pristine git worktree of it, links the
# installed node_modules in, and works there — the cache itself is never modified.
# WITHOUT such a tree there is nothing to run against and the script SKIPS (exit 0): a
# Linux CI box that never built T3 must not go red for a suite it cannot host.
#
#   T3_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/t3-checkout  bash test/t3-overlay.test.sh
#
# Only the inventory whose tag the source actually IS can be applied; the other channel's
# anchors are written against a different upstream tag and are reported as not checked.
